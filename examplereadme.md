# Movie Tracker 

## Description
  Movie Tracker is a comprehensive and user-friendly movie searching website that caters to both casual moviegoers and avid cinephiles. We created this app so that movie lovers could check out which films are trending at the moment, search for movies by title, add movies to a watchlist, see how many stars it has, read the movie summary, watch the trailer, check out who the main actors are, and find out information about actors.â€‹This project gave us the opportunity to learn about collaborating on code, how to utilise server-side API'S, how to implement modals and improved our HTML, CSS and JavaScript Skills.
